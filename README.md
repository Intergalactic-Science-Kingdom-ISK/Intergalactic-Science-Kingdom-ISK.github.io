# Contributing
Welcome to this repository of ISK's official blog. Here, we're writing to educate students (not only those who are on ISK) but students all over Indonesia. If you already have access to this repository, you can clone this repository to your local machine then write a blog post.

# Writing a Blog Post
To write a new post, you can read [our three part blog guide to write a blog post]('https://intergalactic-science-kingdom-isk.github.io/posts/getting-started-bagian-pertama/'). The main points are:

1. `Git Clone https://github.com/Intergalactic-Science-Kingdom-ISK/Intergalactic-Science-Kingdom-ISK.github.io.git` to git clone
2. `Git Pull` to update
3. Make a new folder to write your blog post or continue writing on the available directory. There, you can make a new `markdown` file with a naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-your-blog-title`. Then, you can put `Front Matter` to that file (for clearer instructions please read [our three part blog guide to write a blog post]('https://intergalactic-science-kingdom-isk.github.io/posts/getting-started-bagian-ketiga/')). 
4. `Git add .` your work
5. `Git commit -m "commit message"` if you're ready to commit your work
6. `Git push -u origin master` your work if you're ready to push and deploy

# Scared of These Things?
If you're scared of doing these things by yourself, you can ask us to upload your blog. You just need to send us the writings that you've made and we'll upload it. Of course we'll also give you credit that you're the one that write that blog in our blog.
